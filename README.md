# üè° House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict residential housing sale prices. A **Linear Regression** model was developed, trained, and validated using Python and the Scikit-learn library to estimate property values based on key structural features.

## üéØ Key Outcomes & Performance

The model was trained on an 80/20 data split and evaluated using industry-standard regression metrics:

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R¬≤ Score** | **0.767** | The model explains **76.7%** of the variability in house prices. |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** | **$40,536.19** | On average, the model's predictions are off by approximately **$40,536.19**. |

## Model Demonstration

The trained model was used to predict the price of a sample house not included in the training data:

* **Predicted Sale Price:** **$162,568.34**
* **Actual Sale Price:** **$145,000.00**

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Technology Stack

### Data Preprocessing

* **Feature Selection:** Focused the model on **6 high-impact features** strongly correlated with price: *GrLivArea*, *OverallQual*, *TotalBsmtSF*, *GarageCars*, *FullBath*, and *YearBuilt*.
* **Missing Data Handling:** Utilized **median imputation** (`fillna(df.median())`) to ensure data completeness and model robustness.
* **Validation Check:** A **Residual Plot** was created, confirming that model errors were randomly distributed around the zero line, validating the use of the Linear Regression technique.

### Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** (Data manipulation and cleaning)
* **NumPy** (Numerical operations)
* **Scikit-learn** (*LinearRegression*, *train\_test\_split*, and metrics)
* **Matplotlib** (Visualization for EDA and model evaluation)
